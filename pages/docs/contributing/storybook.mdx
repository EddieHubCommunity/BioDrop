## Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to display what React components are available to use within our project. This also gives you the opportunity to play with the components' functionality and data it displays.

To see what components are available, do the following steps...

1. `npm run storybook`
1. navigate to http://localhost:6006

_note: not all components have been added, this is a great way to contribute to our project_

### Updating LinkFree's Storybooks' components

1. Create a story file in `stories/components` with the same filename as the component but append `.stories.js` to the filename
1. Import the component into the story file, see the existing [example](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/stories/components/user/UserLink.stories.js)
1. Set the default arguments by looking at the requirements from the component itself
1. Run `npm run storybook` to see the added components and visit http://localhost:6006 to interact with them in the browser

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocsLayout title="LinkFree StoryBook Documentation">{children}</DocsLayout>
);
