## Storybook

We use <Link href="https://storybook.js.org">Storybook</Link> to display what React components are available to use within our project. This also gives you the opportunity to play with the components' functionality and data it displays.

The deployed version is available here https://eddiehubcommunity.github.io/LinkFree/?path=/story/pages-username--basic

To see what components are available locally and contribute, do the following steps...

1. `npm run storybook`
1. navigate to `http://localhost:6006`

_note: not all components have been added, this is a great way to contribute to our project_

### Updating LinkFree's Storybooks' components

1. Create a story file in `stories/components` with the same filename as the component but append `.stories.js` to the filename
1. Import the component into the story file, see the existing <Link href="https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/stories/components/user/UserLink.stories.js">example</Link>
1. Set the default arguments by looking at the requirements from the component itself
1. Run `npm run storybook` to see the added components and visit `http://localhost:6006` to interact with them in the browser

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocsLayout title="LinkFree StoryBook Documentation">{children}</DocsLayout>
);
