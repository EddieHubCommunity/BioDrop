## Automated Tests

We use [Playwright](http://playwright.dev) for writing automated end to end (e2e) tests.

1. Install Playwright dependencies `npx playwright install --with-deps`
1. Run tests `npm run test`

**Note**:use `npm ci` if step 1.throws following warning:
<p>

    WARNING: It looks like you are running 'npx playwright install' without first
             installing your project's dependencies.
                                                                                                              
     To avoid unexpected behavior, please install your dependencies first, and     
     then run Playwright's install command:

       npm install                                                               
       npx playwright install
                                                                                                                               
     If your project does not yet depend on Playwright, first install the          
     applicable npm package (most commonly @playwright/test), and                  
     then run Playwright's install command to download the browsers:

       npm install @playwright/test                                              
       npx playwright install

```bash
npm run test
