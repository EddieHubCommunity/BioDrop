## Commit Style

On EddieHub, we use the <Link href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org"> Conventional Commits</Link> format for all changes to the source repositories. This format embeds semantic information in each commit, which is used to generate changelog automatically.

The format for Conventional Commits is as follows:

```swift
<type>([optional scope]): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
###  Type

- `fix:` a commit that fixes a bug
- `feat:` a commit that adds new feature
- `docs:` a commit that adds or improves documentation
- `style:` a commit that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor:` a commit that neither adds a feature nor fixes a bug - such as removing redundant code, simplifying the code, renaming variables, etc.
- `perf:` a commit that improves performance
- `test:` a commit that adds test or corrects existing tests

### Scope
A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g.,
```swift 
feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.
```

### Description
Description contains concise description of the change:
- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body 
Just as in the **description**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes. Breaking Changes should start with the word **BREAKING CHANGE:** with a space or two newlines.

### Examples

#### Commit message with no body
``` 
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

#### Commit message with description and breaking change footer
``` 
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

#### Commit message with scope
``` 
feat(lang): add Polish language
```
