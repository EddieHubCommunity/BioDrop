### points

Points are used in Agile planning within a team. These points are not hours, they are Fibonacci sequence based on complexity, risk and unknown factors. You will not know what `1` point means, but you will know that `1` point is easier than `2` points.

Also note 8 different issues with `1` each is not the same as an `8` point issue because a `1` point issue has little to no risk or unknowns, where as the `8` point issue has a much bigger risk.

Note: `good first issues` are not always `1` point, they could be more but unlikely to be bigger than `3`.
