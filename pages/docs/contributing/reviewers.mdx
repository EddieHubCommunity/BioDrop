## Reviewers

### Issues

For more details on labels and points please see the [Label docs](/docs/contributing/labels).

When new issues are created, they are automatically assigned the label `status: awaiting triage`.

Only maintainers can assign issues. Please keep in mind the following:

- Only assign issues with the label `status: ready for dev`
- Each person should only be assigned 1 open issue at a time

### Pull Requests (Profiles)

#### Lack of activity and waiting times

If there has been no activity **for 2 weeks** by the author to address/correct any maintainer's comments, please close the Pull Request with a comment suggesting they create a new Pull Request when they are ready and link to the Quickstart Guide http://BioDrop.io/docs/quickstart-json

#### `avatar` and `publicStats` json property is included (no longer required)

This is no longer used, please leave an inline comment with the code suggestion to remove it - this will allow another maintainer to accept the changes and we can get the Pull Request merged without delay.

![Inline comment with suggestion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/229017041-afa55fd0-7c09-40b7-bbd0-5f081630d01e.png)

If you wish to make the fix yourself, you can merge to a temporary branch and fix, then create a new Pull Request.

_Note: multiple Pull Requests that need fixing can go into this temporary branch, but please make sure this branch is not open for longer than a few hours to avoid any confusion._

#### Where there are typos by the author

Feel free to leave a comment highlighting these, but typos should **not** block merging the Pull Request.

Explain when merging that the author can submit a new Pull Request correcting the typos with a link to the `Editing` profile docs https://biodrop.io/docs/how-to-guides/editing-json

---

#### Where a reviewer (maintainer or not) has highlighted typos and has raised these as a “suggested change”

We should **not** accept and commit the suggested change as this represents changing the author's profile.

This should not block merging a Pull Request. Explain when merging that the author can submit a new Pull Request correcting the typos with a link to the `Editing` profile docs https://biodrop.io/docs/how-to-guides/editing-json

However, accepting `json` fixes, for example adding a missing comma is allowed as this is not changing their content.

---

#### Where an author has used the wrong icon

For example:

> - non-existent icon (“Twitter” instead of “FaTwitter”)
> - or a mismatched platform icon (“FaTwitter” when the link is for Instagram)

This should **not** block merging a Pull Request as it will fall back to the default icon if not found.

Explain when merging that the author can submit a new Pull Request correcting this and include a link to the `Editing` profile docs https://biodrop.io/docs/how-to-guides/editing-json and the icon page https://biodrop.io/icons

If someone has made inline suggestions, please do **not** accept these (as this is changing the authors content).

---

#### Profile does not have any links

This should **not** be a blocker for merging the PR (despite the name being BioDrop).

Please suggest they add links when they are ready and explain when merging that the author can submit a new Pull Request with a link to the `Editing` profile docs https://biodrop.io/docs/how-to-guides/editing-json

---

#### Bio or Tags length

Whilst there are benefits to a concise `bio` and `tags` it is not for any reviewer to suggest changes.

If the `bio` or `tags` are large, this should **not** block the Pull Request. The author can submit a new Pull Request if they wish to shorten this in the future.

---

#### Conflicts have arisen as the fork is outdated

In the first instance please ask them to resolve these and you may want to provide a link to this video that explains how: https://youtu.be/eze7Y4Rxwtc

---

#### Json package lock fix

In our docs we recommend people use `npm ci` to setup the project dependencies which will not makes changes to the `package-lock.json` file.

However, when `npm install` is used, the lock file will be modified and these changes should **not** be accepted and the Pull Request will be blocked until the changes are removed.

The exception is if the changes have made modifications to the `package.json` file, then the lock file changes are required.

If the author needs help undoing their changes to the lock file, I have created a video on how they can achieve this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHkIXYVpMTo
