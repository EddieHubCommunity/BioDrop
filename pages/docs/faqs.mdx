## My question is not answered by the FAQs/Where can I start a discussion about a feature or idea for BioDrop?

BioDrop uses github discussions to have community conversations about anything related to the BioDrop project that does not fit into an issue. 

An example of a github discussion could be proposing an idea for BioDrop that isn't ready for issue creation yet because it needs more details and input from the community.

Take a look at the discussions and <Link href="https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/BioDrop/discussions">join the conversation</Link>
