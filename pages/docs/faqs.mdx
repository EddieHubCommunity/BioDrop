## How much does it cost to use

It is completely free to use LinkFree.

## Is it all Open Source?

Yes, LinkFree is 100% Open Source. You can use our hosted version, or you can self host through <Link href="docs/single-user-mode">Single User Mode</Link>.

We recommend using the hosted version, so that your Profile is more discoverable and you don't have to do the upgrades and updates yourself.
