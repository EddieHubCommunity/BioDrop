## Style Guide

### Inclusive Language

Where possible use gender-neutral language.

For example:

> - **Recommended:** A maintainer should try to be kind yet constructive in **their** feedback.
> - **Not recommended:** A maintainer should try to be kind yet constructive in **his** feedback.

Avoid terms which may have offensive connotations.

For example:

> - **Recommended:** Contributors should push their Pull Requests to the **main** branch.
> - **Not recommended:** Contributors should push their Pull Requests to the **master** branch.

### Grammar & Punctuation

#### Capitalisation

Use uppercase to describe a product, a feature, the first letter of a sentence, or a person's name.

For example:

> - **Recommended:** We suggest you may want to look at our **Contributing** guide on **GitHub**.
> - **Not recommended:** We suggest you may want to look at our **contributing** guide on **github**.

### Clarity

#### Abbreviations

Do not assume that everyone understands abbreviations, always spell out the full term.

For example:

> - **Recommended:** I will merge your **Pull Request**.
> - **Not recommended:** I will merge your **PR**.

### Accessibility

#### Images

Use Alternative Text to describe images (Alt Text).

#### Emojis

1. Avoid using emojis as bullet points or numbered lists.

For example:

**Not this:**

> - 1️⃣ Fork the repo
> - 2️⃣ Visit the LinkFree repo

**Use this:**

> - **1.** Fork the repo
> - **2️.** Visit the LinkFree repo

2. Avoid using emojis in the middle of a sentence.

   For example:

   - **Not this:** There are 4️⃣ ways you can run the project
   - **Use this:** There are **4** ways you can run the project

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocsLayout
    title="LinkFree Style Guide"
    section="Contributing"
    name="Docs Style Guide"
  >
    {children}
  </DocsLayout>
);
