## Understanding the LinkFree map

This area will describe the linkfree map and answer common questions.

## Technology

In addition to the tech listed in the <Link href="https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/README.md">readme</Link>, the map utilizes open source mapping library <Link href="https://leafletjs.com/">LeafletJS</Link> and <Link href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html?q=">Nominatum</Link> by Open Street Map for retrieving Lat/Long values.

## How do I add myself to the map?

The map data is based on your <Link href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#setting-your-location-and-time-zone">GitHub profile location</Link>. This data is refreshed every 7 days. If you have recently updated your GitHub profile, please wait for the data to refresh until after this period of time.

## I have a location in my profile and it has been longer than 7 days but I still do not see myself.

Test the <Link href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html?q=">Nominatum API endpoint</Link> with your exact profile location to see if it returns a value
If yes, you may ask in Discord for someone to take a look
