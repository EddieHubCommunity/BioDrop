## Quickstart for local development

### Prerequisites

Before contributing or adding a new feature, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Works with Node LTS version v16.17.0)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home)
- Optional [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Switch Node version by using `nvm use` (on Windows, use `nvm use v16.17.0`). If this is not installed, run `nvm install v16.17.0`.

### Local development

You can set this up locally with the following steps

1. make sure Mongo is running
1. install npm depenedencies with `npm ci`
2. a new file will be created `.env` update any details required for example mongo connection string (but usually the default will work fine)
3. start the app with `npm run dev` and visit in the browser http://localhost:3000

Any changes you make will automatically be reloaded in the browser.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocsLayout title="LinkFree Local Development Documentation">
    {children}
  </DocsLayout>
);
