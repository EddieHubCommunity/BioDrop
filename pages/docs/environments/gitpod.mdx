## Gitpod

Gitpod is an open-source application that provides a prebuilt development environment in your browser - powered by VS Code. It also automates the provisioning of a ready-to-code developer environment, so you will have all the dependencies you need (for example MongoDB). With Gitpod, thereâ€™s no need to download any code to your machine. It can create a server-side-dev-environment for you in seconds from any repository on GitHub.

### How to use Gitpod

You can use Gitpod in the cloud. Please note, that Gitpod requires additional configuration to work on the authenticated pages in LinkFree. See instructions for [how to set up your OAuth app](/docs/environments/environment-variables) for more information.

There are 2 ways you can open a repository with Gitpod:

- Prefix the url with `gitpod.io/#`
- Use the [Browser Extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension)

### Development

Once you have opened a repository, you can develop as you usually do! In the next example, we will update our profile from LinkFree.

      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: "number" }}>
        <li>
          Be sure that you have a fork of LinkFree in your Github Profile. If
          you don't have it, check out the{" "}
          <Link href="https://linkfree.io/docs/quickstart-json">
            JSON Quickstart Guide
          </Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          When you have your environment running the database will be empty. You
          need to visit the path{" "}
          <strong>/api/system/reload?secret=development</strong> to load the
          json files
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
  }
/>

Open your fork and follow along.

First, Let's make sure that we have the latest version of the code. To achieve this, run the following commands:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

Now we can update our profile. To do this, create a new branch with the following command

```bash
# Replace YOUR_PROFILE_NAME with your actual profile name.
git checkout -b update-YOUR_PROFILE_NAME
```

Now we are ready to make some modification to our profile. Find the file with your account name in the `data` folder, and modify it as you want.

For example, you can copy and past the following code

```json
"milestones": [
    {
      "title": "Used Gitpod to Update my Profile",
      "date": "May 2023", // update to the correct date
      "icon": "FaCode",
      "description": "Started my profile by using Gitpod",
      "url": "https://gitpod.com/"
    }
  ]
```

As a last step, commit the changes and create a PR in the LinkFree Repository.

### Permissions

If you encounter permission issues, follow the next steps:

- Open the user settings of your Gitpod profile and click on _Integrations_
- Click on the 3 dots after Github and choose _Edit Permissions_
- Make sure that you have checked _public_repo_ and _workflow_
