## Gitpod

Gitpod is an open-source application that provides a prebuilt development environment in your browser - powered by VS Code.<br />
It also automates the provisioning of a ready-to-code developer environment, so you will have all the dependencies you need (for example MongoDB).<br />
With Gitpod, thereâ€™s no need to download any code to your machine. It can create a server-side-dev-environment for you in seconds from any repository on GitHub.<br />

### How to use Gitpod

There are 2 ways you can open a repository with Gitpod:

- Prefix the url with `gitpod.io/#`
- Use the [Browser Extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension)

### Development

Once you have opened a repository, you can develop as you usually do! In the next example, we will update our profile from LinkFree.<br />
***NOTE:*** Be sure that you have a forked of LinkFree in your Github Profile. If you don't have it, check out Quickstart Guide](https://linkfree.io/docs/quickstart).<br />
Open your fork and follow along.

First, Let's make sure that we have the latest version of the code. To achieve this, run the following commands:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

Now we can update our profile. To do this, create a new branch with the following command
```bash
# Replace YOUR_PROFILE_NAME with your actual profile name.
git checkout -b update-YOUR_PROFILE_NAME
```
