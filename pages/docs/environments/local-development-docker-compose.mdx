- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home)
- Optional [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Switch Node version by using `nvm use` (on Windows, use `nvm use v16.17.0`). If this is not installed, run `nvm install v16.17.0`.

### In the cloud (optional)

You can use Gitpod in the cloud [![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/)
