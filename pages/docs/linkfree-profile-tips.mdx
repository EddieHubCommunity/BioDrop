# Linkfree Profile Tips 

Trying to make your Linkfree profile stand out, but have no idea how? Check out this these tips below:

## Tip #1: Make it easier for people to follow your socials
- Do you have a YouTube channel and/or Twitter profile?  Add the link for the subscribe flag, so when they visit your channel you can click right on the subscription or follow button. Check out [this article](https://offeo.com/learn/how-to-create-a-subscribe-link-for-youtube) and [this example](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/twitter-tip-link-to-the-intent-url-instead-of-your-username-7e34f7b077) to create your Twitter follow intent link.
- If you use more than one blog, consider putting them into the different sections. It'll help people know which one to refer to in order to follow your journey. Check out [Christine's profile for inspiration](https://linkfree.io/CBID2).
## Tip #2: Share your achievements and future plans
