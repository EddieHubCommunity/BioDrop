BioDrop is a content sharing and networking platform that enables users to connect their audiences with a single link.

## Welcome to BioDrop

By using BioDrop, you agree to these Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) and the other policies that we link to here and on the Platform.

These Terms (and the policies we link to) apply to your use of our website www.biodrop.io apps and any other software or features provided in connection with our services (collectively the “Platform” or “BioDrop”). Please read these Terms carefully and reach out if you have any questions. If you do not agree with them, please do not use BioDrop.

## Your account

To create an account and become a BioDrop user, you must be at least the minimum age required for GitHub users. We do not permit accounts to be created on behalf of someone else. You are responsible for your account and using it in a lawful way.

When you create an account, you agree to comply with these Terms and that you are legally able to enter these Terms with us.

If you are using BioDrop on behalf of a business you agree that you are authorised by them to act and agree to these Terms on their behalf.

You are responsible for anything that happens to your account, so keep your GitHub login details and password safe and do not share them with anyone. If you think your GitHub account has been compromised, please contact GitHub immediately as we do not store or manage these credentials.

You must not assign or transfer your BioDrop account to someone else, or use your account (or allow it to be used by anyone) in a way which in our reasonable opinion, causes damage to BioDrop or our reputation, or infringes another's rights or applicable laws and regulations.

## What is and is not allowed

We love the variety of content that our users post on BioDrop! However, we want to ensure that everyone who visits the Platform can do so safely. That is why we have our <Link href="https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/BioDrop/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</Link>.

Our Code of Conduct sets out what is and is not allowed on BioDrop, so please make sure you follow them, otherwise we may suspend or permanently remove your account.

You are responsible for your content and you warrant that:

- it is yours or if you are using third party content, you have all of the rights needed to post it on BioDrop (and to let us use it in accordance with these Terms);
- none of your content will violate the privacy, publicity, IP or other rights of anyone else;
- your content will not (i) be misleading or deceptive, intended or designed to misinform, or likely to misinform a reasonable person, (ii) cause either of us to break any laws or legal obligations, and (iii) bring us into disrepute or damage our reputation;
- your content does not contain any viruses or other harmful code, files, or programs designed to interrupt or damage the functionality of the Platform or any other software, hardware or device;
- you will not use, or authorise others to use, automated scripts or other scraping tools to collect information from your profile, or the Platform;
- you will not post any unauthorised advertising, solicitations or endorsements on BioDrop; and
- all of your content complies with the Code of Conduct.

Since laws and regulations differ from country to country, we may ban content that might be legal in some countries, and to take whatever action we think necessary, including removing content or restricting access to it or the Platform.

## Your content

When you post content on BioDrop, you give us the right to display, use, and share it.

When you post content on your profile, you grant us a licence to (i) use, publicly display, distribute, modify, adapt and create derivative works of such content; and (ii) use your name, image, voice, photograph, likeness and any other personal attributes in the content; on the Platform and in our marketing in all media (such as our social channels and any other advertising). This licence is worldwide, royalty-free and perpetual, which means we can use your content anywhere in the world, without paying you fees, for as long as we like. You agree that you have all third party rights necessary to post the content on Linktree and to grant us this licence.

You retain all of your rights in your content. But keep in mind that your content will be publicly accessible, and may be used and re-shared by others on BioDrop and across the internet.

Please do not share personal info that you do not want visible to the world, and never post social security numbers, passport details or similar info that could cause harm in the wrong hands. You may only post personal info relating to others where you have their consent and have kept a record of it.

We do not have to monitor the accuracy, reliability or legality of your content, but we may choose to do so. We may modify, remove or restrict access to content at any time in line with these Terms or apply a sensitive content warning to content that we deem unsuitable for all audiences.

## Our Platform

We own the Platform, but give you a limited right to use it for sharing content and viewing and interacting with other users' content. We are not responsible for any content, products or services made available via other users' profile.

All rights in and to the Platform (excluding your content) are and will remain exclusively owned by the owner of the EddieHub Organisation on GitHub. You will not acquire any rights in BioDrop and you are not allowed to use it (including our brand name or logo) for any purpose (such as to imply a partnership with, or endorsement from BioDrop), without our prior written approval.

As a user, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Platform to create, display, use, play, and upload content in accordance with these Terms. If we provide you with any images, icons, themes, fonts, videos, graphics, or other content, you must only use them on your profile and comply with any guidelines we make available to you.

You must not remove, obscure or alter any proprietary notices or trade marks on the Platform. If you visit BioDrop profiles (a “profile visitor”), we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to view and interact with the Platform via user profiles.

To the extent allowed by law, we are not responsible for any opinions, advice, statements, products, services, offers or other content posted by other users on their profiles.

## Your plan

You can sign up to BioDrop on a free or paid plan (“Premium”) and cancel at any time.

Your plan will start when you accept these Terms and continue until you cancel it. If you cancel a paid plan it will ordinarily continue until the end of your current billing cycle and then automatically convert to a free plan.

To cancel, visit the Pricing page. To the extent permitted by applicable law, payments are non-refundable.

If you have cancelled your plan and would like to permanently delete your account, you can do so on your ‘Account' page. Remember, if you delete your account, you won't be able to reactivate it or retrieve any of the content or info you have added to your profile.

## Our fees

Subscription fees — If you've chosen a paid plan, you must pay your subscription fees when they fall due. Unless otherwise stated, fees are in USD.

All subscription fees will be billed in advance on a recurring basis, based on your chosen billing cycle (either monthly or annual). Your paid plan will automatically renew under these Terms (as updated at the time of the renewal) at the end of your billing cycle unless you have cancelled your plan.

You must provide a valid payment method (i.e. credit card) and accurate billing information when you join. In doing so, you authorise us to charge all fees to such payment method.

You agree that if we charge transaction fees, they will be deducted from the proceeds of your transaction prior to receipt. You're responsible for paying any external fees and taxes (including withholding taxes) if they apply, and income taxes, associated with payments you receive through the Platform.

We may change our subscription fees from time to time, but we'll always give you prior notice (and we will aim to do so at least 1 month in advance). If you do not agree to the revised fees, you can cancel your plan before your next billing cycle starts.

## Privacy & data

By creating your BioDrop Profile, you the user understands and agrees that the BioDrop project and the contributions that you make are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information you submit with it) will be maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with the BioDrop project or the open source license(s) involved.

## Your sponsors

You agree that any donations made to you via our “Sponsor Me” feature are made voluntarily, without exchange for any good or service. You must use this feature solely to collect donations for yourself (and not to collect funds for charities or other causes).

## Confidentiality

If we share any confidential information about us or the Platform with you, you must keep it secret and secure.

From time to time, we may share info with you that is confidential (e.g. we may reveal new and upcoming features to you if you take part in beta testing with us). You must keep this info secret and secure and use reasonable measures to prevent others from accessing it.

## Feedback

We love hearing your ideas on how we can make BioDrop even better! Sometimes, we may make “beta” functionality available to you and seek your feedback.

Keep in mind that if you share feedback with us, we are free to use it however we like, without payment to you (or to not use it at all). We may from time to time make certain functionality of the Platform available to you in “beta” (or similar). You acknowledge that we are still evaluating and testing such beta functionality and it may not be as reliable as other parts of the Platform.

## Open Source

The Platform contains open source software. Certain open source software components are subject to their own applicable licence terms, which are available in BioDrop Repo. To the extent that any such licence terms do not permit the relevant open source component to be licensed to you under these Terms, these Terms will not apply to that component, and your rights and obligations in respect of that component will be governed by the applicable licence terms.

## Liability

We are not liable for your use of the Platform and you are responsible for keeping backups of your own content.

We are not liable for any damages suffered as a result of downloading, installing, or using the Platform, or copying, distributing, or downloading any content from the Platform. You have sole responsibility for the adequate protection and backup of your data, content, and devices used in connection with the Platform.

You will indemnify us against any loss arising out of a breach by you of these Terms, or a third party claim made against us in relation to your content.

Neither of us will be liable for any indirect, punitive, special, incidental or consequential damage (including loss of business, revenue, profits, use, privacy, data, goodwill or other economic advantage), whether for breach of contract, in tort (including negligence) or otherwise, even if we know such damage is possible.

## Disclaimer

Your use of BioDrop and any content contained on the Platform is at your sole risk. The Platform is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including (but not limited to), up-time or availability, or any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.

BioDrop does not make any express or implied warranties or representations, including that:

- the Platform will function uninterrupted, securely or be available at any time or place;
- any errors or defects will be corrected;
- the Platform is free of viruses or other harmful components;
- the Platform is effective or the results of using the Platform will meet your needs; or
- any content on the Platform (including any user content) is complete, accurate, reliable, suitable or available for any purpose.

These Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law and nothing in them is intended to exclude, restrict or modify legal rights that you may have, which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified by contract.

## Third Party Services

We may include in the Platform, access to specific functionality or services which are provided by third parties (e.g. a payment portal). Unless we say otherwise, we do not endorse (or make any warranties or representations in relation to) any third party product or service and do not offer refunds for any amounts you have paid to a third party.

Your use of any third party product or service may be subject to separate terms and conditions, which you are responsible for reviewing, accepting and complying with. If you don't accept or comply with those third party terms, we may suspend or cancel your account, or limit your access to such services within our Platform.

## Cancelling your account

If you do not comply with these Terms, we may suspend or cancel your account or limit the functionality of the Platform, which you have access to (e.g. if you do not pay your fees on time, we may convert your paid plan to a free plan with less features).

Depending on what the non-compliance is, we may not use this right to suspend or cancel your account, but if there is repeat non-compliance, or a material non-compliance, we are likely to. If we suspend or cancel your account, we will usually notify you beforehand (but we don't have to) and you will not receive a refund of any fees paid upfront.

If you think your account has been cancelled by mistake or you have an issue with these Terms or the Platform, please email info@biodrop.io. Both us and you will use all reasonable efforts to resolve the issue in good faith, and neither of us will bring any legal action on the issue until we have spent at least 1 month trying to work it out.

## Changes

BioDrop is constantly evolving and improving. From time to time we may make changes to the Platform or these Terms. If the change will have a significant negative impact on you, we'll notify you beforehand.

We may need to change these Terms from time-to-time to reflect business updates, changes to the Platform (including if we decide to discontinue any functionality, features or part of the Platform), legal or commercial reasons, or otherwise to protect our legitimate interests.

We can make these changes at any time and it's your responsibility to check these Terms now and then for any changes. However, if a change will have a material negative effect on you, we'll use our best efforts to notify you at least 1 month before the change takes effect (e.g. via a notification on the Platform).

Your continued use of the Platform after any changes to the Terms is taken as your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree with the changes, we ask you to stop using BioDrop and cancel your account.

These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales in the United Kingdom. Both you and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of those jurisdictions.
