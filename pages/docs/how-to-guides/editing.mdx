## Edit your profile

There are two types of edits:

1. Making new changes then creating a Pull Request
2. Adding more changes to an existing open Pull request

### New Edits

If you want to edit your profile (for example update a link or remove a link), follow these steps:

1. Log into your GitHub Account
2. Go to your Repositories

![go to repositories](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82668196/208293646-6fbbabe6-f6c6-429f-aaa4-fc77876ce691.png)

3. Then click on the `LinkFree` repo (fork)

4. Now we need to make sure your fork is up to date. You can do this by clicking on `Sync fork` and click `Update branch` (if available)

5. Click `Go to file` and type your GitHub username
6. Click on your `json` file

7. Click the `edit` pencil icon at the top right
8. Make the changes you require

Changes could include:

- updating your Bio
- adding a new section (see examples below)

For how to add each of these sections, please referring to their relevant guides.

9. Scroll to the bottom and commit new file by adding the commit messsage that starts `data: ` followed by your GitHub username (for example `data: SaraJaoude`)

You can skip `optional extended message`

10. Click `create new branch` and you can use the default name provided
11. Then click `Propose changes`

![propose changes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82668196/208293672-3c9480d3-9cf0-452c-8f5f-48559246bc2e.png)

12. Click `compare across forks` and select the destination on the left and the source on the right
13. Click `Create pull request`
14. You will see a title and description for the Pull Request, fill these in and click `Create pull request`

![create pull request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82668196/208293677-79bd2bb8-ee23-4aed-bfef-ea438a9ef3c5.png)

15. Now you need to wait to have your Pull Request (changes) reviewed

![pull request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82668196/208293679-822b4d1e-ecc9-49f5-b363-4a0ecf9922f4.png)

16. You will receive a GitHub notification when you have a comment, review or your Pull Request has been merged
17. Once merged your profile will be available a few minutes later on the same custom url (for example: [linkfree.eddiehub.io/SaraJaoude](https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/SaraJaoude))

You can learn more about these later on in the documentation, in their respective sections.

### Adding more changes to an open Pull Request

The main two reasons for making additional edits to an open Pull Request are:

1. GitHub Action failed
2. Your Pull Request has received a comment requesting changes

![GitHub Action fail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82668196/208976820-242c8b87-2108-480a-9882-a1f8dc652e89.png)

To make further changes to an open Pull Request, follow these steps:

1. Go to your open Pull Request
2. Click on the tab `Files Changed`
3. At the top right of the file click on the 3 dots and then click `Edit file` (this will allow you to edit your file in your branch that is in your fork)
4. Make changes and commit these to the same branch (this should automatically be selected)

GitHub will automatically append these changes to your open Pull Request.
