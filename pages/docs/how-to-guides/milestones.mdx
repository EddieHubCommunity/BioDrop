## Milestones

Demonstrate the highlights of your career by adding Milestones to your Profile. This could be when you got your first job to reaching 100k followers/subscribers.

![Example of LinkFree Milestones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/209209651-87e4f75f-425d-4837-82d0-84030e82ae6f.png)

### Add Milestone

1. Find your `json` file in the `data` folder using your GitHub username, for example `data/sarajaoude.json`

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)_

2. Add a collection called `milestones` at the root of your `json` file which will contain one or more social objects. Each social object must have six fields, `title`, `date`, `icon`, `color`, `description` and `url`, which will look like this:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
{
    "title": "Started Freelancing",
    "date": "May 2010",
    "icon": "FaDollarSign",
    "color": "grey", // or #808080
    "description": "Started my own business",
    "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
}
```
</ClipboardCopy>

| Property    | Required | Description                                                                                     |
| :---------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title       | true     | Main heading of the milestone                                                                   |
| date        | true     | Month and Year                                                                                  |
| icon        | true     | What icon would you like displayed with this milestone                                          |
| color       | true     | What color would you like this milestone to be displayed in. Use hex codes or name of the color |
| description | true     | More details about the milestone, this can include markdown                                     |
| url         | true     | Where can people learn more about the milestone                                                 |
| isGoal      | false    | If this is a future goal                                                                        |

This is what a complete example looks like:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
"milestones": [
    {
        "title": "Started Freelancing",
        "date": "May 2010",
        "icon": "FaDollarSign",
        "color": "grey",
        "description": "Started my own business",
        "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
    }
]
```
</ClipboardCopy>
