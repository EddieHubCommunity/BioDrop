## Links

Let people discover all your great content in one place by adding links to your social media account and other resources.

1. Find your `json` file in the `data` folder using your GitHub username, for example `data/sarajaoude.json`

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the <Link href="/docs/how-to-guides/editing">Editing Guide</Link>_

2. Add a collection called `links` at the root of your `json` file which will contain one or more objects that must have three fields `name`, `url` and `icon`.

This is an example of a single link object:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
{
  "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
  "url": "https://twitter.com/SaraJaoude",
  "icon": "FaTwitter"
}
```
</ClipboardCopy>

| field | type   | required | description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :---- | :----- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name  | string | true     | The display name for the button                                                                                                                                                                |
| url   | string | true     | Full url to the resource                                                                                                                                                                       |
| icon  | string | true     | The icon you would like displayed. We support the following icon sets: **Fa** and **Si** from React Icons.                                                                                     |
| group | string | false    | Optional property to group links together, any without a group will be added to the end in a new group called "Others". If no groups are used then no groups are displayed including "Others". |

To add more links add another object inside the links collection. For example:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/SaraJaoude",
      "icon": "FaTwitter"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Instagram",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/EddieAndSaraExplore",
      "icon": "FaInstagram"
    }
  ]
```
</ClipboardCopy>
