## Links

Let people discover all your great content in one place by adding links to your social media account and other resources.

![LinkFree Profile links example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/209361460-61d05252-24ce-4417-86b4-72e18f8fec54.png)

1. Find your `json` file in the `data` folder using your GitHub username, for example `data/sarajaoude.json`

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)_

2. Add a collection called `links` at the root of your `json` file which will contain one or more objects that must have three fields `name`, `url` and `icon`.

This is an example of a single link object:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
{
  "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
  "url": "https://twitter.com/SaraJaoude",
  "icon": "FaTwitter"
}
```
</ClipboardCopy>

| field | type   | description                                                                                                |
| :---- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name  | string | The display name for the button                                                                            |
| url   | string | Full url to the resource                                                                                   |
| icon  | string | The icon you would like displayed. We support the following icon sets: **Fa** and **Si** from React Icons. |

To add more links add another object inside the links collection. For example:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/SaraJaoude",
      "icon": "FaTwitter"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Instagram",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/EddieAndSaraExplore",
      "icon": "FaInstagram"
    }
  ]
```
</ClipboardCopy>

3. Now you can commit your file and create a Pull Request, for more details please see [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)

_Clicks on these social shortcuts that match any of your links will also increment their respective counters_

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocsLayout title="LinkFree Links Documentation">{children}</DocsLayout>
);
