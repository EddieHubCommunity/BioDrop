## Premium Features

If you have a Premium account you have these extra features.

### Hide Sign up button

At the bottom right of the Profile there is a sign up button if the user is not signed in to BioDrop. If you have a Premium account this is automatically hidden for you all the time, regardless if the user is logged in or not.

### Hide Header or Footer

You can use the toggles to hide/show the header or footer from your Profile.

### Custom Domain

You can use your own domain for your Profile. This is a great way to make your Profile look more professional.

In the Premium section on manage your profile, add the domain name you want to use. You will need to add a CNAME record to your DNS settings for your domain name. The CNAME record should point to `biodrop.io`.

<Alert
  type="warning"
  message={
    <>
      <strong>NOTE: </strong>
      When using your custom domain, the header and footer will be hidden by default.
    </>
  }
/>

You will also need to update your domain's DNS to point to BioDrop.

You can do this by adding an `A` record for your apex domain `@` that points to `76.76.21.21`.

<Alert
  type="warning"
  message={
    <>
      <strong>NOTE: </strong>
      These changes can take up to 48 hours to have an effect.
    </>
  }
/>
