## Events - with JSON

Whether you are hosting or attending events, let people know what you are up to by adding these to your Profile.

Note: This guide helps you add an Event where you already have a Profile (created with JSON or through Forms).

All future events also appear on the Events page for the app.

### Add Event

1. Create a folder that matches your GitHub username in the `data` directory and then in that folder create another folder called `events`.  
   For example: `data/eddiejaoude/events/`

2. In your folder add a `json` file with any name you like. We recommend putting the date first and then appending it with the event name.
   For example: `2023-09-13-javascript-conference.json`.

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the <Link href="/docs/how-to-guides/editing-json">Editing Guide</Link>_

3. This `json` file will contain one object for the event and must have these six fields: `isVirtual` and/or `isInPerson`, `name`, `description`, `date`, `url`, and `location` (this field will be required only when `isInPerson` is `true`).
   It can also optionally include other fields. For instance: `userStatus` & `speakingTopic`. It will look like this:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
{
  "isVirtual": true,
  "isInPerson": true,
  "name": "Open Source GitHub reviews",
  "description": "In this livestream I will be going reviewing your **Open Source projects** and profiles! I will be joined by **Amanda**, a Developer Advocate.",
  "date": {

    "cfpClose": "2022-10-09T17:00:00.000+00:00"
  },
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqIFD02OkVE",
  "price": {
    "startingFrom": 0
  },
  "location": {
    "road": "Messe Berlin South Entrance & CityCube",
    "city": "Jaff√©strasse",
    "state": "Berlin",
    "country": "Germany"
  },
  "userStatus": "speaking",
  "speakingTopic": "Open Source"
}
```
