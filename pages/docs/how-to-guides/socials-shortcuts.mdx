## Social shortcuts

Add a shortcut to your favourite social media accounts at the top of your Profile.

![Example of LinkFree Social Shortcut icons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/208973239-cc6a8541-3e34-47fd-8f76-104a3cf6ee4f.png)

### Add Social shortcuts

1. Find your `json` file in the `data` folder using your GitHub username, for example `data/sarajaoude.json`

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)_

2. Add a collection called `socials` at the root of your json file which will contain one or more social objects. Each social object must have two fields, `platform` and `url`, which will look like this:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
{
  "icon": "FaTwitter",
  "url": "https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude"
}
```
</ClipboardCopy>

This is what a complete example looks like:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
"socials": [
  { "icon": "FaTwitter", "url": "https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude" },
  { "icon": "FaGithub", "url": "https://github.com/eddiejaoude" },
  { "icon": "FaYoutube", "url": "https://youtube.com/eddiejaoude" }
]
```
</ClipboardCopy>

3. Now you can commit your file and create a Pull Request, for more details please see [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)

The icon you would like displayed. We support the following icon sets: **Fa** and **Si** from React Icons.

_Clicks on these social shortcuts that match any of your links will also increment their respective counters_
