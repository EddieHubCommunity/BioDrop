## Bio

Describe in a few words who you are.

The bio string in the json file is special! It allows for the use of Markdown. This will allow you to use the formatting styles like italic and bold.

### Markdown

1. Find your `json` file in the `data` folder using your GitHub username, for example `data/sarajaoude.json`

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)_

2. In the `bio` string, you can wrap text in double asterix to make it bold, here is an example

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
{
  "bio": "Open Source DevRel | Founder of **EddieHub** | **GitHub** Star"
}
```
</ClipboardCopy>
