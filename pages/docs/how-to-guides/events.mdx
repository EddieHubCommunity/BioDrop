### Add Event

1. Find your `json` file in the `data` folder using your GitHub username, for example `data/sarajaoude.json`

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)_

2. Add a collection called `events` at the root of your `json` file which will contain one or more social objects. Each social object must have six fields, `isVirtual` and/or `isInPerson`, `color`, `name`, `description`, `date` and `url`, which will look like this:

```js
{
  "isVirtual": true,
  "color": "red",
  "name": "Open Source GitHub reviews",
  "description": "In this livestream I will be going reviewing your **Open Source projects** and profiles! I will be joined by **Amanda**, a Developer Advocate.",
  "date": {
    "start": "2022-12-09T16:00:00.000+00:00",
    "end": "2022-12-09T17:00:00.000+00:00"
  },
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqIFD02OkVE"
}
```

| Property               | Description                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| isVirtual / IsInPerson | Is the event virtual or in person or both                   |
| color                  | What color would you like this milestone to be displayed in |
| name                   | Name of the event                                           |
| description            | More details about the event, this can include markdown     |
| date                   | Start and end date plus time of the event                   |
| url                    | Where can people learn more about the event                 |

This is what a complete example looks like:

```js
"events": [
  {
    "isVirtual": true,
    "color": "red",
    "name": "Open Source GitHub reviews",
    "description": "In this livestream I will be going reviewing your **Open Source projects** and profiles! I will be joined by **Amanda**, a Developer Advocate.",
    "date": {
      "start": "2022-12-09T16:00:00.000+00:00",
      "end": "2022-12-09T17:00:00.000+00:00"
    },
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqIFD02OkVE"
  }
]
```
