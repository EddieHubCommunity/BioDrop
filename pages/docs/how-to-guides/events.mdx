## Events

Hosting or attending events, let people know what you are up to by adding these events to your Profile.

![Example of LinkFree Profile events](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/209358132-0a3e20a8-a996-4a9f-b9c3-90d3056d2cf3.png)

All future events also appear on the Events page for the app.

### Add Event

1. Create a folder that matches your GitHub username in the `data` directory and then in that folder create another folder called `events`. For example `data/eddiejaoude/events/`

2. In your folder add a `json` file with any name you like. We recommend putting the date first and then appending it with the event name. For example `2023-09-13-javascript-conference.json`.

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)_

3. This `json` file will contain one object for the event and must have six fields, `isVirtual` and/or `isInPerson`, `color`, `name`, `description`, `date` and `url`, which will look like this:

<ClipboardCopy>
```js
{
  "isVirtual": true,
  "isInPerson": true,
  "color": "red",
  "name": "Open Source GitHub reviews",
  "description": "In this livestream I will be going reviewing your **Open Source projects** and profiles! I will be joined by **Amanda**, a Developer Advocate.",
  "date": {
    "start": "2022-12-09T16:00:00.000+00:00",
    "end": "2022-12-09T17:00:00.000+00:00",
    "cfpClose": "2022-10-09T17:00:00.000+00:00"
  },
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqIFD02OkVE"
}
```
</ClipboardCopy>
