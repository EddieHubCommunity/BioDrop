### Giving a Testimonial

You can give a Testimonial for another LinkFree user by going to their Profile and clicking on the "Add testimonial" button. This will take you to GitHub issue with the fields pre-populated for that user and you can fill in your testimonial.

The issue will look like this:

**NOTE**: Don't have a LinkFree account but want to give a testimonial? Do not worry! Log in to your GitHub account (if you don't have one, check out [Eddie's course](https://www.eddiejaoude.io/course-github-profile-landing) to help you) and follow the steps above.
