## Profile Tips

Make your LinkFree Profile stand out by following these tips.

### Links: Prompt people to subscribe/follow

- For YouTube links you can append your url with `?sub_confirmation=1` which will ask the visitor if they wish to subscribe
- For Twitter you can use the "intent" link to ask people if they would like to follow you when visiting your profile. This is done with `https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=TWITTER-USERNAME` (for example [https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=eddiejaoude](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=eddiejaoude))

### Milestones: Share your achievements and future goals

- Whether it's reaching 1K followers on Twitter, winning a contest, or creating a project that helped your employer achieve company goals, share your achievements in the [Milestones](/docs/how-to-guides/milestones-json) tab.
- Hold yourself accountable by sharing your future goals in the [Milestones](/docs/how-to-guides/milestones-json) tab.

### Testimonials: Give and receive feedback

- A good way to increase your Profile's visibility is to give [testimonials](/docs/how-to-guides/testimonials-json) to other LinkFree users, as you will appear on their Profile page.
- To increase your Profile's credibility you can add [testimonials](/docs/how-to-guides/testimonials-json) to your Profile people have given you.

### Events: Share your upcoming events

- Another way to get more visibility to your Profile is to add your event activity, this is a good way to network and connect with others in your niche. Share what [events](/docs/how-to-guides/events-json) you are participating in your Profile, these will also appear in the [Events](/events) page on the app.
