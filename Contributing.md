- Use the imperative mood (example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called subject line) to 50 characters or less
- Capitalize the subject line
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what, why, vs, and how
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
