# What is LinkFree?

LinkFree is the Open Source alternative to LinkTree. A platform where people in tech can have a single hub to showcase their content in order to accelerate their career, whilst contributing to an Open Source project and being part of a community that has a say in where the project is going.

Your profile will have links to your social media and content. You can also add your timeline, testimonials, and upcoming events that you are participating in.

### Gitpod

In the cloud-free development environment which will have all the dependencies you need (for example MongoDB).

You can use Gitpod in the cloud [![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/)

### Local development

This environment is fully on computer and requires each dependency (for example MongoDB) to be installed and set up, but gives you the most flexibility for customisation.

#### Prerequisites

Before contributing or adding a new feature, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Works with Node LTS version v16.17.0)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home)
- Optional [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Switch Node version by using `nvm use` (on Windows, use `nvm use v16.17.0`). If this is not installed, run `nvm install v16.17.0`.

#### Commands

You can set this up locally with the following steps:

1. copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update any details required
1. MongoDB is required, it is possible to use `docker-compose up` to start the MongoDB service
1. `npm ci`
1. `npm run dev`

### Local development with Docker Compose

This will allow you to run your favourite IDE but not have to install any dependencies on your computer like NodeJS and MongoDB.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) V2.

#### Commands

1. `docker compose up`
