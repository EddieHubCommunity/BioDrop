# What is BioDrop?

A platform where people in tech can have a single hub to showcase their content in order to accelerate their career, whilst contributing to an Open Source project and being part of a community that has a say in where the project is going.

> **Note**: give extra attention to JSON formatting and the GitHub Action after you create the Pull Request

Read more in the official documentation - https://biodrop.io/docs/environments/github-ui

### Gitpod

In the cloud-free development environment which will have all the dependencies you need (for example MongoDB).

[![Open BioDrop in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/BioDrop)

Read more in the official documentation - https://biodrop.io/docs/environments/gitpod

### Local development

This environment is fully on your computer and requires each dependency (for example MongoDB) to be installed and set up, but it gives you the most flexibility for customisation.

#### Prerequisites

Before contributing or adding a new feature, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Works with Node LTS version v18.16.1)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) (v6+)
- Optional [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Switch Node version by using `nvm use` (on Windows, use `nvm use v18.16.1`). If this is not installed, run `nvm install v18.16.1`.

#### Commands

You can set this up locally with the following steps:

1. copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update any details required
1. MongoDB is required, it is possible to use `docker compose up` to start the MongoDB service
1. `npm ci`
1. `npm run dev`

Read more in the official documentation https://biodrop.io/docs/environments/local-development#local-development

### Local development with Docker Compose

This will allow you to run your favourite IDE but not have to install any dependencies on your computer like NodeJS and MongoDB.

#### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) V2. or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#:~:text=Docker%20Desktop%20is%20a%20one,share%20containerized%20applications%20and%20microservices)

#### Commands

1. `git clone https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/BioDrop`

2. `cd BioDrop`

3. `docker compose up`

4. In your browser on localhost:3000 you should now see the project up and running.

5. Now you need to upload the data in your mongoDB instance. `localhost:3000/api/system/reload?secret=development`

6. Recheck localhost:3000 to confirm data is uploaded, you should see current amount of active users.

> **Note**
> If you wanna look at the database, you can use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) with connection string as `mongodb://localhost:27017/biodrop`

> "I had another similar (paid) service. I tried BioDrop for a week and I got almost double the clicks on the links in the same period, redirecting from the same link. I decided to start using it regularly. I am very satisfied. It's not just a list of links but it's backed by a great Open Source community."

Some of my favorite features are the barcode for profiles and testimonials. If you are reading this and don't have a profile, I highly recommend doing that. Thank you, Eddie and EddieHub community, for building this incredible app."
