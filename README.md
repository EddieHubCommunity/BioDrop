Read more in the official documentation - https://linkfree.io/docs/environments/gitpod 

### Local development

This environment is fully on your computer and requires each dependency (for example MongoDB) to be installed and set up, but it gives you the most flexibility for customisation.

#### Prerequisites

Before contributing or adding a new feature, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Works with Node LTS version v18.16.1)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home)
- Optional [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Switch Node version by using `nvm use` (on Windows, use `nvm use v18.16.1`). If this is not installed, run `nvm install v18.16.1`.

#### Commands

You can set this up locally with the following steps:

1. copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update any details required
1. MongoDB is required, it is possible to use `docker compose up` to start the MongoDB service
1. `npm ci`
1. `npm run dev`

Read more in the official documentation https://linkfree.io/docs/environments/local-development#local-development

### Local development with Docker Compose

This will allow you to run your favourite IDE but not have to install any dependencies on your computer like NodeJS and MongoDB.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) V2.

#### Commands

1. `docker compose up`

> "I had another similar (paid) service. I tried LinkFree for a week and  I got almost double the clicks on the links in the same period, redirecting from the same link. I decided to start using it regularly. I am very satisfied. It's not just a list of links but it's backed by a great Open Source community."

Some of my favorite features are the barcode for profiles and testimonials. If you are reading this and don't have a profile, I highly recommend doing that. Thank you, Eddie and EddieHub community, for building this incredible app."
