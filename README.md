# LinkFree by EddieHub

- LinkFree connects audiences to all of your content with one link. It is an open-source alternative to [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) implemented in JavaScript.
- It was initially created on a YouTube [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jorl_vcp-Ew).

## üëá Prerequisites

Before contributing or adding a new feature, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Works with Node LTS version v16.17.0)
- Optional [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Switch Node version by using `nvm use` (on Windows, use `nvm use v16.17.0`). If this is not installed, run `nvm install v16.17.0`.

## QUICKSTART

You can use Gitpod in the cloud or you can set this up locally with the following steps

1. copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update any details required
1. mongodb is required, it is possible to use `docker-compose up` to start the mongodb service
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`

## Storybook

See what components are available

1. `npm run storybook`
1. navigte to http://localhost:6006

### Contributing to Storybook

1. Create story file in `stories/components` with the same filename as the component but append `.stories.js` to the filename
1. Import the component into the story file, see existing [example](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/nextjs/stories/components/user/UserLink.stories.js)
1. Set the default arguments by looking at the requirements from the component itself
1. Run `npm run storybook` to see the added components and interact with them in the browser and visit http://localhost:6006

Alternatively, skip all the steps by using [![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/)

## üë®‚Äçüíª Contributing

- Contributions make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
- Any contributions you make are **truly appreciated**.
- Check out our [contribution guidelines](./docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## üé≠ To Add Your Profile

Create a file named using your GitHub username `username.json` in the directory `data`, this will ensure it is unique.

**Optional fields: `milestones` and `type(personal | community)`**\
Looking for inspiration? You can view the following profiles for an example:

- [Eddie Jaoude](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/public/data/eddiejaoude.json)
- [Naomi Carrigan](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/public/data/nhcarrigan.json)
- [Kaiwalya Koparkar](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/public/data/kaiwalyakoparkar.json)

Your brand new file should look something similar to this one:

> **Note**: add/remove `links` objects to customise your profile, `milestones` are optional

```json
{
  "name": "YOUR NAME",
  "displayStatsPublic": true,
  "type": "personal",
  "bio": "Open Source Enthusiast!",
  "avatar": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.png",
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
      "icon": "github"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME",
      "icon": "twitter"
    }
  ],
  "milestones": [
    {
      "title": "Started Freelancing",
      "date": "December 2021",
      "icon": "dollar",
      "color": "grey",
      "description": "Started freelancing",
      "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
    }
  ]
}
```

Your URL will be `https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/<yourusername>`

For example: <https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/eddiejaoude>

To include your `avatar`, you have to replace `<yourusername>` with your **GitHub username** in the format of `https://github.com/<yourusername>.png` and it will automatically be fetched from your GitHub account.

For example: <http://github.com/eddiejaoude.png>

Note: after your PR gets merged, the project still needs to be deployed for your profile to be displayed

### Available Icons:

Check [Icons.md](/icons.md) for all the supported icons.

### Single user mode

If you wish to self-host this app for a single user, follow the same steps as above, but then in the file `config/user.json` add your username.

For example

```json
{
  "username": "eddiejaoude"
}
```
