# LinkFree by EddieHub

- LinkFree connects audiences to all of your content with just one link. It is an open-source alternative to [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) implemented in JavaScript.
- It was initially created on a YouTube [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jorl_vcp-Ew).

## üé≠ To Add Your Profile

Create a file named using your GitHub username `username.json` in the directory `public/data`, this will ensure it is unique.

**Optional fields: `links`, `milestones` and `type(personal | community)`**\
Looking for inspiration? You can view the following profiles for an example:

- [Eddie Jaoude](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/public/data/eddiejaoude.json)
- [Naomi Carrigan](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/public/data/nhcarrigan.json)
- [Kaiwalya Koparkar](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/public/data/kaiwalyakoparkar.json)

Your brand new file should look something similar to this one:
(note: add/remove `links` objects to customise your profile, `milestones` are optional)

```json
{
  "name": "YOUR NAME",
  "type": "personal",
  "bio": "Open Source Enthusiast!",
  "avatar": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.png",
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
      "icon": "github"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME",
      "icon": "twitter"
    }
  ],
  "milestones": [
    {
      "title": "Started Freelancing",
      "date": "December 2021",
      "icon": "dollar",
      "color": "grey",
      "description": "Started freelancing",
      "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
    }
  ]
}
```

Your URL will be `https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/<yourusername>`

For example: <https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/eddiejaoude>

To include your `avatar`, You just have to replace `<yourusername>` with your **github username** in the format of `https://github.com/<yourusername>.png` and it will automatically be fetched from github account.

For example: <http://github.com/eddiejaoude.png>

Note: after your PR is merged, the project still needs to be deployed for your profile to be displayed

### A simple gif version of adding your profile

### Single user mode

```json
{
  "username": ""
}
```
