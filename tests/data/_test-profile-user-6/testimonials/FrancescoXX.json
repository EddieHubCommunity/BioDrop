{"title": "Eddie === Open Source", "description": "it's difficult to describe in such a few words what Eddie has done and he is doing for the Developer community. The passion he transmits online is 1/10 of the one he transmits live, and meeting him and having the first collaboration on Youtube in 2020 was a great moment. I wish him and Sara the best for the future and to geek out as much as possible. Eddie === Open Source", "date": "2023-01-27"}
