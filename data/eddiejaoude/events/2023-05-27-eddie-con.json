  "description": "On Saturday 27 May my livestream is going to be a little bit different... I am going to combine this with our EddieHub community call - with an extra twist! It is going to be a mini-unconference! So what is an unconference? Well - you can submit a talk and this will be chosen by the community! This is the perfect opportunity if you want to practice your public speaking skills or if you want to test out a topic that you want to submit for another event. The one rule that applies is.... it must be open source related! I will be there to support you. What are you waiting for? Go and submit your talk now!",
