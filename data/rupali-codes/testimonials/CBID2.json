  "description": "I had the pleasure to work with Rupali as an Open Source Maintainer for LinksHub. She is a wonderful leader, receptive to new ideas, and always eager to learn and implement new skills, something that is very inspirational to see as a woman navigating the open source community. If you are looking for a self-directed learner and an all-around humble individual, I highly recommend hiring Rupali for your team.",
