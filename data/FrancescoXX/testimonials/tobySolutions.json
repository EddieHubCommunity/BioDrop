  "description": "I got to know Francesco last year(2022) through Dennis Ivy's Hackathon when my team was position 8 out of 11 and Francesco was asked to pronounce my name in that specific Livestream, from there, I stalked him on Twitter and found out that he had a community called 4c (Cool Community Of Content Creators). I joined and during one of the 4calls volunteered to be a maintainer of the website which he then agreed; this was like 2 weeks before Hacktoberfest and I had little to no experience with Github or Hacktoberfest.\n\nHe literally transformed my life by bringing me to open source and mentoring me on the ways how a community should work and how to grow as a personal brand. Most of the things I have achieved today in one way or another other have connections to this great guy.\n\nThanks, Francesco!",
