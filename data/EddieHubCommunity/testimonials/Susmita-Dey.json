	"description": "EddieHub is the first community to help me start my journey to Open Source. I wasn't aware of anything called **Open Source** before I met @eddiejaoude on a Twitter space and came across ** EddieHub community ** and found so many people here geeking out, helping each other, making PRs and issues, and many more.The repositories maintainers are so kind here;always ready to help each other.I created my first issue and PR here and contributed to this community and soon became a member.It helped me to customize my GitHub profile and taught me how to collaborate with people all over the world. I 'm very happy being here as a member now and helping people geeking out together and learning new things. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you Eddie Sir for making this awesome community! üöÄ EddieHub is invaluable: It 's beyond any ratings :)",
