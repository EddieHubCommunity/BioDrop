I didn't even know how to code when I joined, now am skilled enough to help other people. I love the gesture of the community, the community is built over strong pillars. Love how the community is really friendly, everyone is up for helping anyone. Eddie is awesome, the moderators are awesome and the community comprising all of this, plus really friendly members is even awesome üòÑ", "date": "2023-01-10"}
