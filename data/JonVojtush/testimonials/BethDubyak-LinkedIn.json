  "description": "Jon served as our scrum master through a very transformative time for Vincent Payment Solutions. He brings to the table not only the technical skills needed, but also the personal skills necessary to drive a team of diverse individuals. He manages the development process in balancing business and technical requirements, and provided to me the additional expertise during our growth phase. I would recommend Jon as a scrum master for growing or established products.",
