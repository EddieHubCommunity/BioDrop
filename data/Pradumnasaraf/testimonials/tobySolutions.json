{"title": "A mentor to GenZ Techies", "description": "Pradumna has always been an inspiration to GenZ techies like me that had never found open source interesting. I went from being a nobody in the open-source community to a maintainer of 2 very big open-source projects in the 4c community! Pradumna is such an inspiration to me when it comes to open source and he's one of the people I credit for everything I have achieved in Open source today", "date": "2023-01-21"}
