{"title": "The Open Source and DevOps guy", "description": "Pradumna is an absolute gem for the Developer Community. His passion and approach to people will bring him far. Not following him literally everywhere is a great mistake if you want to know more about Open Source, DevOps, and other things related to tech. Also very friendly and always keen to help. I hope to meet him in person as soon as possible, then we can make an updated version of the testimonial!", "date": "2023-01-27"}
