  "description": "Ali is such an amazing individual and friend. I only knew Ali personally in late 2022 and we sort of met through 4C, but, ever since I got to know him, I can confidently say that Ali has been such a good influence on my personality and being. He's no doubt the best person I have ever known from Social media.\n\nHe doesn't know this, but, there he has inspired me countless times when it comes to my tech career and building my skills while making content as an individual. Great guy and an amazing developer!!",
