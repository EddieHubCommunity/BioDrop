      "description": "In January 2023, I began learning about Open Source contribution. Firstly, I revised my Python concepts, and in addition, I learned Git and Github from YouTube. After that, I decided to learn the basics of Web Development, as it would help me understand open-source projects better. My first contribution was fixing a typo on a personal portfolio of a developer. Although my PR was rejected for some reasons, it was a great learning experience. Later on, I joined Twitter and learned about Eddie Jaoude's Linkfree project, which was open-source. It was a life-changing moment for me. Immediately, I started learning about it, and on February 14th, 2023, I made my second PR on the Linkfree repository. However, I closed the PR since I was not confident about my contributions. I took some time to learn more about Git, and on February 19th, 2023, I made a proper PR that was accepted. From that day onwards, I am actively contributing to two projects simultaneously.",
