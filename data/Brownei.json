  "bio": "Frontend Web Developer who just started his career less than a year ago. I have always been fascinated with the power of the internet and how websites are built. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own and quickly discovered my undying passion for frontend development. I am well-versed in a frontend framework which is React and I do hope to always stays up-to-date with the latest web technologies. Despite my short experience, I has already completed several projects, ranging from small static websites to large e-commerce platforms. I understand the importance of creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces and I do hope will strive to exceed the clients' expectations. I is a team player and enjoys working collaboratively with other developers, designers, and project managers. I am always willing to share my knowledge and learn from my colleagues. I is constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge.",
