  "bio": "I am Anuj Kumar, Graduated in 2022 with mechanical Engineering degree. During my college i got to know about computer and got super excited in tech field, but due not getting to meet amazing people like Eddie and Kunal Kushwaha. I dont get chance to explore in this domain my peers are all about competitive programming. Well in lockdown period i meet eddie and kunal and got in tech Twitter. From them i got into openSource, I am very grateful to them that currently i am exploring with guidance in tech field . About my Domain in tech after exploration i have decided to pursue my career in the field of cloud and infrastructure.",
